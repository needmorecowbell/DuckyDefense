Cross Platform HID defense software

All systems are vulnerable to HID attacks. For about $3 and a few seconds near a victim's computer, a hacker could exploit
and extract valuable information. These attacks all work by immediately typing a payload when plugged into a victim machine.
This software protects the user by requesting a random passphrase for any newly plugged in hid devices on the system.
